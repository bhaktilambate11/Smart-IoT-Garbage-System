## Features 

1.  **Contactless Operation:** IR sensor detects hand/object motion to trigger lid opening. 
2.  **Arduino-Based Control:** Utilizes a microcontroller for precise signal processing and automation. 
3.  **Safe Current Control:** Relay switching ensures secure power management to the servo motor. 
4.  **Automated Lid Actuation:** Servo motor precisely controls automatic lid opening and closing. 
5.  **Energy Efficient:** Motor is powered only during active use, minimizing consumption. 
6.  **Compact Design:** Optimized for minimal wiring and efficient space usage. 

## Working Principle

1.  IR sensor detects an object within a 10‚Äì15 cm range. 
2.  Arduino processes the input signal and sends a HIGH signal to the relay. 
3.  Relay then powers the servo motor. 
4.  The motor rotates to open the dustbin lid. 
5.  After a short, configurable delay, the lid closes automatically. 

## Results 

This Smart IoT Garbage System successfully achieves:

1.  **Quick Detection & Response:** Consistent detection and lid actuation within 2‚Äì3 seconds. 
2.  **Stable Performance:** Demonstrates reliable and consistent operation over time. 
3.  **Low Consumption:** Minimal false triggers and efficient power usage, ensuring energy savings.
